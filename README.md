# Useful resources
I knew the background of a lot of this before doing this project but I had not written any code to handle of this before. Even still, I found the docs for pysdy to be super well written and easy to follow. Definitly worth a read!

1) [pysdr modulation](https://pysdr.org/content/digital_modulation.html )
2) [pysdr IQ sampling](https://pysdr.org/content/sampling.html)
3) [pysdr pulse shaping](https://pysdr.org/content/pulse_shaping.html) not as related but also good read
4) [pysdr link budget](https://pysdr.org/content/link_budgets.html) related to the paper in the attached pdf
